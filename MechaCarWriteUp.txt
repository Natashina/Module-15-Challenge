1. Multiple linear regression

A linear model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using a number of variables within the MechaCar mpg dataset shows the following result:

Call:
lm(formula = mpg ~ vehicle_length + vehicle_weight + spoiler_angle + 
    ground_clearance + AWD, data = MechaCar)

Residuals:
     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max 
-19.4701  -4.4994  -0.0692   5.4433  18.5849 

Coefficients:

Residual standard error: 8.774 on 44 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.7149,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.6825 
F-statistic: 22.07 on 5 and 44 DF,  p-value: 5.35e-11

1.1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
According to our results, vehicle length and ground_clearance (as well as intercept) are statistically unlikely to provide amounts of variance due to chance. 
In other words the vehicle length and ground_clearance have a significant impact on miles per gallon variable. 

1.2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
P-values of vehicle_length and ground_clearance are 2.60e-12 and 5.21e-08 respectively.
They are much less than 5% threshold. 
We can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.

1.3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
From the model r-squared value is 0.7149, which means that approximately 71% of our variance in miles per gallon can be explained by the predictors.
We can conclude that the model predicts it effectively.


2. Suspension Coil Summary

2.1. A summary statistics table provides the following result for the suspension coil (pounds-per-inch).

Mean = 1499.531
Median = 1499.747
Variance = 76.23459
St_dev = 8.731242

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per inch. 
The current manufacturing data meet this design specification because the variance is equal to 76, less than 100 pounds per inch.


2.2 A quantitative Shapiro-Wilk test on entire population shows the following:

Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  S_coil$PSI
W = 0.85286, p-value = 6.011e-11

Our P-value of 6.011e-11 is less than 0.05 threshold, that means that dataset does not meet the assumption of normal distribution.
That is why the dataset has been split into subsets of Lot1, Lot2, Lot3. The results of Shapiro-Wilk test for each of these subsets are included below:

data:  lot1$PSI
W = 0.93767, p-value = 0.01091

data:  lot2$PSI
W = 0.97282, p-value = 0.3004

data:  lot3$PSI
W = 0.9864, p-value = 0.8299

We can use the one-sample t-test to assert the similarities or differences in our datasets - Lot2 and Lot3, since only thsese two lots have normal distribution (p-value > 0.05).

One Sample t-test for Sample of 20 items:

data:  (sample_table2$PSI)
t = -0.52235, df = 19, p-value = 0.6075
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 1499.531
95 percent confidence interval:
 1497.746 1500.603
sample estimates:
mean of x 
 1499.175 

One Sample t-test

data:  (sample_table3$PSI)
t = 0.31877, df = 19, p-value = 0.7534
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 1499.531
95 percent confidence interval:
 1492.777 1508.712
sample estimates:
mean of x 
 1500.744 

The results of t-tests for lot2 and lot3 allow to drow a conclusion that there is no statistical difference between the mean of the sample distribution and the mean of the population distribution.


3. Study design

Our goal is to perform statistical study in order to predict new MechaCar sales based on customer preference metrics.

We need to collect competitor data for cars in the same class as the MechaCar, for example, mid-size, SUV etc.

The metrics of interest to a consumer - 1) horse power 2) price 3) color 4) interior volume 5) electric/gas 6) range (miles driven after refueling) 7) fuel efficiency.

We can collect large dataset of competitor cars, including the number of cars sold across the full spectrum of each of these metrics.

The question the study will ask: is there a non-random correlation between each metric and sales volume?

The null hypothesis is that no correlation exists between each metric and sales volume.
The alternative hypothesis is that there is a measurable correlation.

Statistical test should be used to test this hypothesis.

We would use multiple linear regression model with each metric listed above as independent variables and sales volume as dependent variable.

Assuming that Multiple linear regression has high correlation, we will be able to predict the sales volume for MechaCars with different characteristics.
